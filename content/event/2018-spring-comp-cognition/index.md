# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "The ability to visually recognize objects despite differences in orientation would be advantageous for fish because they frequently view objects from many aspect angles. We tested the ability of five goldfish to recognize 3D stimuli from multiple aspect angles in different rotation planes using a two-alternative forced choice task. The fish were trained to discriminate between two objects (plastic models of a frog and turtle) at 0 degrees in the x-plane. Mean choice accuracy during training was 86%. Then, they were tested with the same objects at novel aspect angles (90, 180, and 270 degrees). In Experiment 1, the objects were rotated in the x-plane (picture plane). Choice accuracy exceeded chance at 90 (M = 97%), 180 (M = 96%), and 270 (M = 96%) degrees. In Experiment 2, the objects were rotated in the y-plane (depth plane). Choice accuracy exceeded chance at 90 (M = 86%), 180 (M = 90%), and 270 (M = 96%) degrees. Overall performance in the current study (M = 95%) exceeded performance with rotated 2D objects in our past study (M = 66%). It may be easier for fish to recognize objects despite differences in orientation when objects are 3D vs. 2D."
