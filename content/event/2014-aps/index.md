abstract: "The impact of mindfulness meditation and passive relaxation on emotional memory, mindfulness, and affect was examined using brief mindfulness and relaxation inductions. Negative affect was significantly reduced by both. Mindfulness was significantly greater following the mindfulness induction. Despite improving affect and mindfulness, the inductions did not differentially affect emotional memory."
